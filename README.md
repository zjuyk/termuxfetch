# termuxfetch
A simple script to show system info in termux. Inspired by neofetch.

## Why another fetch?

I find that neofetch can not show enough info which I want to show in termux. Termux provide a termux-api to show some hardware info. I'll make use of it and try to show system info  with a more proper way, such as fit the screen size.
